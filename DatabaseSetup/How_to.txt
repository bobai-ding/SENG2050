0. Make sure tomcat 8.5.38 is installed and %CLASSPATH% and %JAVA_HOME% are defined

1. First need to use SQL version 5.1.36
    - https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/

2. Make sure to click add to firewall and add to windows PATH (leave everything else as default)

3. Set the root password of the SQL to 'pass'
    - Make sure it is the root password being set (should ask for it during install)

4. Next, change the lines in tomcat-install/conf/server.xml:

<Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.UserDatabaseRealm"
	               resourceName="UserDatabase"/>
</Realm>

to:
	
<Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JDBCRealm"
	driverName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
	connectionURL="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Will_Simi_Lachlan"
	connectionName="root" 
	connectionPassword="pass"
	userTable="tomcat_users" 
	userNameCol="user_name" 
	userCredCol="password"
	userRoleTable="tomcat_users_roles" 
	roleNameCol="role_name" />
</Realm>


5. Cut and paste lib folder from  top level of webapp and paste in tomcat-install (to add necessary libraries to tomcat to enable SQL database) 

6. Open SQL command line, copy contents of createTables.sql (top level of webapp) into command line
    - Test this worked by going:
          USE will_simi_lachlan;

7. Run tomcat as normal

8. Open browser and access: http://localhost:8080/c3282938_c3280751_c3283344_FinalProject/
