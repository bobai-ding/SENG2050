1. First need to use sql version 5.1.36
    - https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/

2. Make sure to click add to firewall and add windows PATH stuff

3. Set the root password of the sql to 'pass'
    - Make sure it is the root password being set (should ask for it during install)

4. Next, open the server.xml file in DatabaseSetup/tomcat/conf and change the lines it says in tomcat-install/conf/server.xml

5. Copy lib folder from git and paste in tomcat-install

6. Open sql command line, copy contents of DatabaseSetup/Add_to_database/createTables.sql into command line
    - Test this worked by going:
          USE will_simi_lachlan;
          SHOW TABLES;
